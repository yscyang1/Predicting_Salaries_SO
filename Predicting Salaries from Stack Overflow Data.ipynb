    "# 1 - Using Random Forest for Salary Prediction\n",
    "The goal of this project is to use [Stack Overflow user survey data](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/?utm_source=so-owned&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=dev-survey-2017&utm_content=blog-link&utm_term=data) to predict salaries.  Specifically, I will be using the responses and self reported salaries from the 2017 dataset to try and predict salaries for the responses in the 2018 dataset.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For an in depth look at how I pre-processed the data, check out my notebook [here](https://github.com/yscyang1/Predicting_Salaries_SO/blob/master/Pre-Processing%20Data.ipynb). But briefly, what I did was identify matching questions in 2017 and 2018 and isolated those responses.  I then had to make sure that the answers between the two years were the same.  For example, for the same question, in 2017 the answers could be based on a disagree strongly to agree strongly scale, whereas in 2018 the answers could be on a 1-10 scale.  \n",
